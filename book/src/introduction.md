# Introduction

Here's a book that'll help you program in Rust on the GBA.

It's very "work in progress". At the moment there's only one demo program.

## Other Works

If you want to read more about developing on the GBA there are some other good resources as well:

* [Tonc](https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm), a tutorial series written
  for C, but it's what I based the ordering of this book's sections on.
* [GBATEK](http://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm), a homebrew tech manual for
  GBA/NDS/DSi. We will regularly link to parts of it when talking about various
  bits of the GBA.
