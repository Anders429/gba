# Introduction

Here's a book that'll help you program in Rust on the GBA.

It's very "work in progress". At the moment there's only one demo program.

## Getting Help

If you want to contact us you should join the [Rust Community
Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/aVESxV8) and ask in the `#gamedev`
channel.

* `Ketsuban` is the wizard who knows much more about how it all works
* `Lokathor` is the fool who decided to write a crate and book for it.

If it's _not_ a GBA specific question then you can also ask any of the few
hundred other folks in the server as well.

## Other Works

If you want to read more about developing on the GBA there are some other good resources as well:

* [Tonc](https://www.coranac.com/tonc/text/toc.htm), a tutorial series written
  for C, but it's what I based the ordering of this book's sections on.
* [GBATEK](http://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm), a homebrew tech manual for
  GBA/NDS/DSi. We will regularly link to parts of it when talking about various
  bits of the GBA.
* [CowBite](https://www.cs.rit.edu/~tjh8300/CowBite/CowBiteSpec.htm) is another
  tech specification that's more GBA specific. It's sometimes got more ASCII
  art diagrams and example C struct layouts than GBATEK does.
