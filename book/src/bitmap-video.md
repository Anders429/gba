# Bitmap Video

Our first video modes to talk about are the bitmap video modes.

It's not because they're the best and fastest, it's because they're the
_simplest_. You can get going and practice with them really quickly. Usually
after that you end up wanting to move on to the other video modes because they
have better hardware support, so you can draw more complex things with the small
number of cycles that the GBA allows.

## The Three Bitmap Modes

As I said in the Hardware Memory Map section, the Video RAM lives in the address
space at `0x600_0000`. Depending on our video mode the display controller will
consider this memory to be in one of a few totally different formats.

### Mode 3



### Mode 4

### Mode 5

## Using Mode 3
