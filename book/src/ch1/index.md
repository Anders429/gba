# Ch 1: Hello GBA

Traditionally a person writes a "hello, world" program so that they can test
that their development environment is setup properly and to just get a feel for
using the tools involved. To get an idea of what a small part of a source file
will look like. All that stuff.

Normally, you write a program that prints "hello, world" to the terminal. The
GBA has no terminal, but it does have a screen, so instead we're going to draw
three dots to the screen.
