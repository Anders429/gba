# Introduction

This is the book for learning how to write GBA games in Rust.

I'm **Lokathor**, the main author of the book. There's also **Ketsuban** who
provides the technical advisement, reviews the PRs, and keeps my crazy in check.

The book is a work in progress, as you can see if you actually try to open many
of the pages listed in the Table Of Contents.

## Feedback

It's also often hard to tell when you've explained something properly to someone
who doesn't understand the concept yet. Please, if things don't make sense then
[file an issue](https://github.com/rust-console/gba/issues) about it so I know
where things need to improve.
