# GBA Limitations

There's a lot of seemingly normal Rust code that you can't write when compiling
for the GBA.

I mean there's a lot of stuff that you _can_ write, but we don't wanna get

We'll start the book by reviewing all the major things we don't have so that we
can avoid any surprises later.
