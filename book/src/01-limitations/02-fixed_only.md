# Fixed Only

In addition to not having the standard library available, we don't even have a
floating point unit available! We can't do floating point math in hardware! We
could still do floating point math as software computations if we wanted, but
that's a slow, slow thing to do.

Instead let's learn about another way to have fractional values called "Fixed
Point"

## Fixed Point

TODO: describe fixed point, make some types, do the impls, all that.
