# Introduction

This is the book for learning how to write GameBoy Advance (GBA) games in Rust.

I'm **Lokathor**, the main author of the book. There's also **Ketsuban** who
provides the technical advisement, reviews the PRs, and keeps my crazy in check.

The book is a work in progress, as you can see if you actually try to open many
of the pages listed in the Table Of Contents.

## Feedback

It's very often hard to tell when you've explained something properly. In the
same way that your brain will read over small misspellings and correct things
into the right word, if an explanation for something you already understand
accidentally skips over some small detail then your brain can fill in the gaps
without you realizing it.

**Please**, if things don't make sense then [file an
issue](https://github.com/rust-console/gba/issues) about it so I know where
things need to improve.
