# Book Goals and Style

So, what's this book actually gonna teach you?

My goal is certainly not just showing off the crate. Programming for the GBA is
weird enough that I'm trying to teach you all the rest of the stuff you need to
know along the way. If I do my job right then you'd be able to write your own
crate for GBA stuff just how you think it should all go by the end.

Overall the book is sorted more for easy review once you're trying to program
something. The GBA has a few things that can stand on their own and many other
things are a mass of interconnected concepts, so some parts of the book end up
having to refer you to portions that you haven't read yet. The chapters and
sections are sorted so that _minimal_ future references are required, but it's
unavoidable that it'll happen sometimes.

The actual "tutorial order" of the book is the
[Examples](../05-examples/00-index.md) chapter. Each section of that chapter
breaks down one of the provided examples in the [examples
directory](https://github.com/rust-console/gba/tree/master/examples) of the
repository. We go over what sections of the book you'll need to have read for
the example code to make sense, and also how we apply the general concepts
described in the book to the specific example cases.
