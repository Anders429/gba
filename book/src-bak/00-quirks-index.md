# Quirks

The GBA supports a lot of totally normal Rust code exactly like you'd think.

However, it also is missing a lot of what you might expect, and sometimes we
have to do things in slightly weird ways.

We start the book by covering the quirks our code will have, just to avoid too
many surprises later.
