//! Module for all things relating to the Video RAM.
//!
//! Note that the GBA has six different display modes available, and the
//! _meaning_ of Video RAM depends on which display mode is active. In all
//! cases, Video RAM is **96kb** from `0x0600_0000` to `0x0601_7FFF`.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! Note that all possible bit patterns are technically allowed within Video
//! Memory. If you write the "wrong" thing into video memory you don't crash the
//! GBA, instead you just get graphical glitches (or perhaps nothing at all).
//! Accordingly, the "safe" functions here will check that you're in bounds, but
//! they won't bother to check that you've set the video mode they're designed
//! for.
